Goal: 

Today, I plan on learning the fundamental concepts behind neural networks. I'll begin by learning the structure of a neural network and what each component does.

What I’ve Accomplished: 

I learned about the perceptron portion of a neural network and the inputs/outputs it uses to determine the importance of a single decision. I’ve discovered that each perceptron acts as a single step in grand decision-making process. Each one takes in an input with a bias, which determines how likely it is to return a 1, and carries a weight to process how important it is.
